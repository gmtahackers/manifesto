# Manifesto

Technology advances ahead faster than a single person can manage.

In a world that can't stop inventing, the wealth of new technologies, tools and github projects may, at times, feel overwhelming. Despite innumerable fast-moving trains of technologies, there doesn't seem to be a sight-seeing train for getting hands-on with the broad landscape of the technology world. Besides, there wouldn't be time to explore the landscape inside the reality of business hours. The value of exploring and experimenting has been wildly acknowledged by smart companies, but exercising innovation days is rare in practice. Personal side-projects lose attention once initial excitement gets replaced by competing daily activities.

We want to bring back hands-on exploration of state-of-the-art technology. We aim at monthly get-togethers with practical subjects around a wealth of technologies. We don't shy away from theoretical viewpoints, but aim to get our hands dirty in order to learn what technologies feel like. We want to push each other to explore. We unite to claim collective time to enhance ourselves and each other, and ultimately the world at large.
